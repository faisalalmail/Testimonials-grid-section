### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Actual application of flexbox and grid view for different screen sizes.

In this challenge, I went a step further and created a third view to match mid size monitors, this allows the the content to be more dynamic and visually appealing on different screen sizes.


### Continued development

I guess more responsive stuff!!
